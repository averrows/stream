A live streaming service like Twitch receives and broadcasts video using a combination of video encoding, transmission protocols, and server infrastructure. Let's break down the process into a few steps:

Video Encoding: The video stream is captured by the broadcaster's device (such as a computer or a dedicated streaming device) and encoded in real-time using a video codec (e.g., H.264, VP9, or AV1). The encoder compresses the video into smaller chunks, typically called "frames" or "segments." Each frame represents a small portion of the video.

Chunking: The encoded video stream is divided into smaller chunks, usually ranging from a few seconds to several seconds in duration. These chunks allow for efficient transmission and playback. Each chunk is assigned a unique identifier.

Transmission: The video chunks are then sent from the broadcaster's device to the streaming service's servers over the internet. This is achieved using streaming protocols like Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP), or WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication).

Server Infrastructure: The streaming service's servers receive the video chunks and perform several tasks. They store the incoming chunks in a buffer, which allows for smooth playback even if there are network fluctuations or delays. The servers also handle load balancing to distribute the incoming video chunks across multiple servers to handle the high volume of concurrent viewers.

Distribution: Once the video chunks are stored on the servers, they are made available to viewers through a content delivery network (CDN). CDNs consist of geographically distributed servers strategically placed around the world. When a viewer requests to watch a stream, the CDN identifies the nearest server with the video chunks and delivers them to the viewer's device.

Playback: The viewer's device receives the video chunks from the CDN and begins playback. The player on the viewer's device buffers a few video chunks in advance to ensure a smooth viewing experience. As the viewer watches the stream, subsequent video chunks are fetched and played in a continuous manner, allowing for real-time viewing.

The video file structure itself does not have a fixed format for live streaming. Instead, live streaming relies on the delivery of video chunks in real-time. The video chunks contain compressed video data, usually in a format like MPEG-DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) or HLS (HTTP Live Streaming). These formats enable adaptive bitrate streaming, where the streaming service can dynamically adjust the quality of the video based on the viewer's network conditions.

Overall, the combination of encoding, chunking, transmission protocols, server infrastructure, and content delivery networks enables live streaming services like Twitch to receive and broadcast video in real-time to a large audience.
